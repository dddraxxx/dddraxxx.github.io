# Useful resources

Below are some resources that I found interesting and useful during my study on AI (\* means my ongoing study and I will update them from time to time). They are collections of books, videos and courses that can help build the foundation of academia research in AI. Names not listed in order.

More personal flavor:
1. \*[Mit 18.657, math for maching learning, only slides and exercises but I like precise explanations](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-657-mathematics-of-machine-learning-fall-2015/)
2. \*[Stanford convex optimization, really cool teaching](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)
3. [Lee Hung-Yi's ML class, really interesting](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2019-spring.php)
4. [Gilbert Strang on Linear Algebra, quick recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrHlHbtiSM0)
5. [Edan Mayer, interesing viewpoint](https://www.youtube.com/c/EdanMeyer)
6. [Yannic Kilcher, paper reading and ML news](https://www.youtube.com/c/YannicKilcher)

Really classic ones:
1. [D2L, both English and Chinese versions, used to be my reference](https://d2l.ai/).
2. [Stanford CS231n, Stanford's course on neural networks](https://cs231n.github.io/)
3. [Coursea ML, Andrew NG's course on machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
4. [Fast.ai, quick hands-on experience with deep learning](https://www.fast.ai/).
