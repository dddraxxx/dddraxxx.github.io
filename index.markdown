## About me

My name is **Dong Qihua** and I have an English name **Drax**. My interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, especially its generalization (I am also excited about AI applications in real life, like in medical diagnosis), including:
1. multi-modal methods (the combination of knowledge builds more intelligent models!)
2. reliability of the generalization (which is related to research on the difference between models and human perception, how to find the difference and how to identify arguments that models use).

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Liao Jing](https://liaojing.github.io/html/). For the past year, I have focused on several computer vision projects and built solid foundations in the field. I also learned how to propose my own research idea instead of just following the directions of the professors (like the recent project on how to initialize 3D models). Feeling curious and interested gradually became my motivation for research. To be honest, doing research is more effort-taking yet more exciting than I presumed.

During my undergraduate years, I minored in Math, took some challenging courses (real analysis), and achieved better grades than most of my math-majored peers. I also excelled in the algorithm course and thus was selected to participate in the ICPC contest on behalf of my school. At that time, I was more interested in courses that required more mathematical knowledge; while I did not set up my goal in the academy and really make an effort to dig into academic areas (I probably spent too much time in social activities and basketball club). I am now determined and oriented toward the field of AI after a year's journey in it (some useful help can be found [here](./items/resources.html)).

"There will be no AI winter," stated the great Geoffery Hinton, and I can see it in the hundreds of papers published every day, in the complexity and black-box nature of a neural network, in the exploding growth of internet data, and the untapped potential of AI-specific computing accelerators. I want to be a part of it and make meaningful contributions to the field and, if there is one, the "ultimate answer" of general intelligence. Though chances are that I may not be bestowed with the gift of unraveling the myth, I believe through persistent effort and proper guidance, I will enjoy the journey and transfer AI's advances to the benefit of society. That's why I'm pursuing a Ph.D., and I hope that years from now, I'll be grateful I did.

### Hobbies
My biggest hobby is playing basketball (used to watch every NBA game broadcast on TV and play for hours every day). It is relaxing and refreshing for me.
