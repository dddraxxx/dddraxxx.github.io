## About me

My name is **Dong Qihua** and I have an English name **Drax**. My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, especially its generalization, including:
1. multi-modal methods (the combination of knowledge builds more intelligent models! This might be a better way of unsupervised learning)
2. reliability of the generalization (which is related to research on the difference between models and human perception, how to find the difference and how to identify arguments that models use).

Also, I am excited about AI applications in real life, like in medical diagnosis. I am now seeking a Ph.D. position. 

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Liao Jing](https://liaojing.github.io/html/). For the past year, I have focused on several computer vision projects and built solid foundations in the field. I also learned how to propose my own research idea rather than merely following the professor's instruction (like the recent project on how to initialize 3D models). Feeling curious and interested gradually became my motivation for research. To be honest, doing research is more effort-taking yet more exciting than I anticipated.

I minored in math throughout my undergraduate years, took some tough courses (real analysis), and outperformed most of my math-majoring peers. I also excelled in the CS algorithm course, and as a result, I was selected to represent my school at the regional ICPC contest. I was more interested in classes that required more mathematical knowledge at the time; while I did not know my specific academic goal, I knew that I had a strong desire to delve deeply into something fascinating and enjoy the thrill of discovery. After a year in the field of AI, I am now determined and oriented toward it (some useful help can be found [here](./items/resources.html)).

"There will be no AI winter," stated the great Geoffery Hinton, and I can see it in the hundreds of papers published every day, in the complexity and black-box nature of a neural network, in the exploding growth of internet data, and the untapped potential of AI-specific computing accelerators. I want to be a part of it and make meaningful contributions to the field and, if there is one, the "ultimate answer" of general intelligence. Though chances are that I may not be bestowed with the gift of unraveling the myth, I believe through persistent effort and proper guidance, I will enjoy the journey and transfer AI's advances to the benefit of society. That's why I'm pursuing a Ph.D., and I hope that years from now, I'll be grateful I did.

### Hobbies
My biggest hobby is playing basketball (used to watch every NBA game broadcast on TV and play for hours every day). It is relaxing and refreshing for me. I also play guitar to amuze myself.
